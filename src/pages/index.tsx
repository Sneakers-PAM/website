        <p>
          Sneakers-PAM comes from years of running privileged access in two major hospitals and a
          private healthcare organisation, from the seats of a CISO, a VP of infrastructure and a
          CIO. At every one of them the most dangerous passwords were the ones nobody could find
          quickly: shared admin passwords in spreadsheets and ticket comments, values pasted into
          chat, and audit answers spread across three logs, if they lived anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment that sums it up: a system is down, people are waiting, and the tool holding
          the one password that matters asks for an approval, then a second factor, then the second
          factor again. By the third prompt nobody is thinking about the outage, only about the
          shortcut they'll take next time. A control that costs that much attention stops being a
          control.
        </p>
        <p>
          So Sneakers-PAM is built around one idea: know who's asking and what they've already
          proved, instead of asking again. Owners decide and nobody approves their own request, one
          task gets one prompt, and every action lands in an audit trail nobody can quietly edit.
          Privileged access has no organisation-specific core, so it's open source, for anyone who
          needs it.

        <p>
          Sneakers-PAM is pre-1.0 and under active development. The services, the appliance and this
          site are all being built in the open as a from-scratch, open-source PAM. Interfaces,
          configuration and the install flow can still change before v0.1.0. Nothing here is ready
          for production use yet — most pages below mark what's still coming.
