# ✍️ Add and share secrets

Anyone can keep secrets in their own personal folder. To add one to a shared folder you need the
**Manage** permission there, which a folder's owners have.

Anyone signed in can also start a new top-level folder with **New shared folder** in the sidebar,
and owns it, unless a site admin turned on **Restrict top-level folders to admins**
([Top-level folders](../concepts/secrets-and-folders.md#top-level-folders)).

## ➕ Create a secret {#create}

1. Choose **New secret** (from a folder you can manage, or from your personal folder).
2. Pick its **type**. The type decides the fields and what Sneakers-PAM can do with it; see
   [Secret types](../admin-guide/secret-types/index.md) for the list.
3. Fill in the fields. For the types below, the editor can make the value for you:
   - **A password field:** generate one that meets the folder's password policy.
   - **An SSH key:** generate a key pair in the vault (Ed25519, RSA 4096, RSA 2048 or ECDSA
     P-256), or import one you have. The private key is stored and never shown in the editor again.
   - **A certificate:** upload a PKCS#12 / PFX, PEM, DER, PKCS#7, JKS or JCEKS file; its details
     are read from the certificate.
4. Save. The first version of the secret is recorded.

The editor marks the fields the type requires. A save with one of them empty is refused, and the
message names the field. For a GitHub App, see [Storing a GitHub App](../github-app-guide.md).

:::tip[Values that are already in a file]

To store a value that's already on disk, such as a key file, without pasting it, use
`sneakers-put`, which reads it from the file ([Agents and the MCP](./agents-and-the-mcp.md#sneakers-put)).

## ✏️ Edit, move and retire {#edit}

- **Edit** changes fields; every save that changes something makes a new version, and the
  [history](./use-secrets.md#history) shows which fields changed.
- **Change type** moves a secret, or several from a folder's list, to another type, with a preview
  of what happens to each field before you confirm ([Changing a secret's type](../change-type-guide.md)).
- **Move** a secret to another folder you can manage. From your personal folder to a shared one
  is free. From a shared folder into a personal one needs a site admin: for anyone else it becomes
  a move request that a site admin decides.
- **Retire** takes a secret out of use without deleting it; it's hidden from lists unless you show
  retired secrets, and it can be restored.

## 🤝 Share a folder or a secret {#share}

Open a folder's or a secret's **Manage access** (the **Actions** menu on a secret) to choose who
can do what. Folder changes apply to everything in the folder and its subfolders once saved;
secret changes apply to that secret.

| Permission | What it lets someone do |
|---|---|
| Reveal | Read the secret's fields and reveal or copy its values |
| Manage | Add, edit, move and retire secrets, and change sharing |
| Approve | Decide other people's access requests and reveals for it |
| Informed | Get notifications about it, such as a move or a rotation |

- **Share with** a person, a group, or everyone who can sign in (only a site admin can change a rule
  for everyone).
- **Owners** of a folder have Reveal, Approve and Manage on everything in it.
- **Rules inherited** from a folder above are shown as inherited and locked here; change them on
  that folder.
- **Advanced (RACI grid)** shows the rules in order, each allowing or denying, the way a firewall
  reads them: the first rule that matches decides. A deny there wins over the simple view.
- **What would this user get?** The simulator shows what a person would be allowed, with your
  unsaved changes, before you save.

Site admins can see every shared folder but aren't approvers or managers by themselves; they get
those only through a rule, like anyone else ([Folders and permissions](../admin-guide/folders-and-permissions.md)).
