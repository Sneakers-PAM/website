# Install on Proxmox VE

This page imports the Sneakers-PAM appliance's `qcow2` disk image into Proxmox VE as a new VM and
boots it. On the first boot the appliance enrols its own Secure Boot keys and restarts. On the
second it keeps its disk keys in the VM's TPM and opens its setup page. You only need the Proxmox
VE web UI and the `qm` command on the Proxmox host.

:::note[Run on Proxmox VE]

The `qcow2` image is new in v0.1.0-rc.4. Upgrades from v0.1.0-rc.5 through v0.1.0-rc.7 have been run on a real Proxmox VE
host. If a step doesn't match what you see, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/Sneakers-PAM/sneakers-appliance/issues/new/choose) with the
exact output, and leave out your addresses, host names and any passwords.

:::

## Before you start

- A Proxmox VE 8 host, and a root shell on it: the node's **Shell** in the web UI, or SSH.
- An **amd64** (x86-64) Proxmox VE host. The `qcow2` is amd64 only, and so are the appliance's
  update files: it doesn't run on arm64. To run Sneakers-PAM on arm64, use the Helm charts (see
  [Getting started](./getting-started.md#choose-how-to-install)).
- A storage that holds VM disks, such as `local-lvm`, with 64 GiB free (the image is thin, so less
  is used at first), and a bridge for the VM's network, such as `vmbr0`.
- 4 CPU cores and 16 GiB of memory for the VM.
- A free VM ID, such as `120`. `pvesh get /cluster/nextid` prints one.
- The release you're installing, such as `0.1.0-rc.7` (the tag without its `v`), from the
  [appliance releases](https://github.com/Sneakers-PAM/sneakers-appliance/releases).
- To check the release's signature as well as its checksum,
  [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/) v3 or newer on the Proxmox host.

## 1. Set the names this page uses

In the root shell on the Proxmox host, set the VM ID, the storage, the bridge and where the image
goes. Change the values to yours:

```sh
VMID=120
STORAGE=local-lvm
BRIDGE=vmbr0
VERSION=0.1.0-rc.7
IMAGE="/root/sneakers-appliance-$VERSION-amd64.qcow2"
```

## 2. Download the image and check it

```sh
cd /root
base="https://github.com/Sneakers-PAM/sneakers-appliance/releases/download/v$VERSION"
curl -fLO "$base/sneakers-appliance-$VERSION-amd64.qcow2"
curl -fLO "$base/sneakers-appliance-$VERSION-amd64.qcow2.sha256"
sha256sum -c "sneakers-appliance-$VERSION-amd64.qcow2.sha256"
```

`sha256sum` prints `OK`. To check the release's signature too:

```sh
curl -fLO "$base/sneakers-appliance-$VERSION-amd64.qcow2.sigstore.json"
curl -fL -o sneakers-release.pub "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sneakers-PAM/sneakers-appliance/v$VERSION/keys/production/cosign.pub"
cosign verify-blob --key sneakers-release.pub --insecure-ignore-tlog=true \
  --bundle "sneakers-appliance-$VERSION-amd64.qcow2.sigstore.json" "sneakers-appliance-$VERSION-amd64.qcow2"
```

It prints `Verified OK`, after a warning that the transparency log was skipped: the release key
signs without one. Stop here if either check fails.

## 3. Create the VM

```sh
qm create "$VMID" --name sneakers-appliance --ostype l26 \
  --machine q35 --bios ovmf \
  --efidisk0 "$STORAGE:1,efitype=4m,pre-enrolled-keys=0" \
  --tpmstate0 "$STORAGE:1,version=v2.0" \
  --cores 4 --memory 16384 \
  --scsihw virtio-scsi-single \
  --scsi0 "$STORAGE:0,import-from=$IMAGE,iothread=1" \
  --boot order=scsi0 \
  --net0 "virtio,bridge=$BRIDGE" \
  --agent enabled=1
```

What each part is for:

- `--machine q35 --bios ovmf`: a UEFI VM. The appliance boots only with UEFI.
- `--efidisk0 ...,pre-enrolled-keys=0`: the VM's firmware starts **without** Secure Boot keys, so
  the appliance can enrol its own. With Proxmox's pre-enrolled keys it would also trust Microsoft's
  keys, which the appliance never does, and it couldn't enrol its own.
- `--tpmstate0 ...,version=v2.0`: a TPM 2.0. The appliance seals its disk keys to it (full
  protection). Without one, it asks to keep them in a key file instead (reduced protection).
- `--scsihw virtio-scsi-single` and `--scsi0 ...,import-from=...`: imports the image as the VM's
  disk, on its own VirtIO SCSI controller.
- `--net0 virtio`: a VirtIO network card. `--agent enabled=1`: the QEMU guest agent (step 6).

To give the appliance more than 64 GiB, grow the disk now, before the first boot. The first boot
gives the extra space to its data and backup volumes:

```sh
qm disk resize "$VMID" scsi0 128G
```

Once the VM exists, you don't need the downloaded image any more: `rm "$IMAGE"`.

## 4. First boot: Secure Boot keys

```sh
qm start "$VMID"
```

Open the VM's **Console** in the web UI. After a short while the appliance shows a **Secure Boot**
screen with **1. Use Secure Boot with the org keys (recommended)** selected. Press Enter.

It writes its keys, shows `Secure Boot keys enrolled. Restarting with Secure Boot on.` and restarts
by itself. You don't need the firmware menu.

To run without Secure Boot instead, type `no secure boot` and press Enter. The appliance then runs
with reduced protection, and you can turn Secure Boot on later from its admin page without
reinstalling.

## 5. Second boot: the TPM and setup

After the restart, the appliance asks where to keep its disk keys, with **Use the TPM
(recommended)** selected. Press Enter. It formats its data volumes, then shows `Protection: full`,
the setup address (`https://<address>:8443`), the certificate fingerprint and a one-time setup
code. The code is 16 characters and never uses `0`, `1`, `G`, `I`, `L`, `O`, `Q` or `U`, so look-alike
characters can't trip you up.

Open the address in a browser, check the fingerprint against the console, enter the code and follow
the setup steps: the first admin, the recovery keys and the rest.

The recovery key you make or add here isn't a login key, and SSH and PuTTY won't accept it. Keep it
offline. For SSH, get a login key from the **Access** page once setup is finished; it comes with a
`.ppk` file for PuTTY.

After a restart or a shutdown, the appliance can take more than 5 minutes to come back. That's
expected.

## 6. Check the guest agent

The appliance runs the QEMU guest agent, so the VM's **Summary** shows its IP addresses, a backup
can freeze its file systems, and **Shutdown** and **Reboot** in Proxmox stop the appliance cleanly.
From the host:

```sh
qm agent "$VMID" ping
qm guest cmd "$VMID" network-get-interfaces
qm shutdown "$VMID"
```

`ping` prints nothing when the agent answers. `qm shutdown` stops the appliance's services in order
and powers it off, which can take more than 5 minutes. After a restart, or when you next start it
after a shutdown, it can take more than 5 minutes to come back. That's expected.

The agent answers only those kinds of requests. It refuses to run programs, read or write files, or
set passwords, so `qm guest exec` fails. The Proxmox host gets no way into the appliance that its
admins don't already have.

## If something goes wrong

- **The Secure Boot screen has no default and says the firmware isn't in Setup Mode:** the EFI disk
  was made with pre-enrolled keys. Power the VM off with `qm stop "$VMID"`, replace the EFI disk and
  start again:

  ```sh
  qm set "$VMID" --delete efidisk0
  qm set "$VMID" --efidisk0 "$STORAGE:1,efitype=4m,pre-enrolled-keys=0"
  qm start "$VMID"
  ```

- **The appliance says the box has no TPM:** the VM has no TPM state disk. Stop it and add one with
  `qm set "$VMID" --tpmstate0 "$STORAGE:1,version=v2.0"` before you go on, or press Enter to keep
  the keys in a key file (reduced protection).
- **The console shows a firmware screen or `BdsDxe: No bootable option`:** the boot order doesn't
  name the disk. Run `qm set "$VMID" --boot order=scsi0` and start the VM again.
- **`qm agent "$VMID" ping` says the agent isn't running:** the appliance starts the agent once it's
  past the Secure Boot screen, so wait for the second boot. Check that `qm config "$VMID"` shows
  `agent: enabled=1`.
- **The console's text is small, or a code is hard to read:** OVMF usually starts the screen at
  800x600, so the appliance uses a smaller font (66x27). At 1024x768 it uses its large font (64x24).
  The setting stays on the VM's EFI disk, so you only do this once, and it doesn't affect the disk
  keys sealed to the TPM:

  1. Stop the VM with `qm shutdown "$VMID"`, open its **Console** and click **Start Now**.
  2. When the Proxmox logo shows, press Esc until the firmware menu opens.
  3. Open **Device Manager**, then **OVMF Platform Configuration**.
  4. Set **Change Preferred Resolution for Next Boot** to **1024x768**, then pick **Commit Changes
     and Exit**.
  5. Press Esc until you're back at the main menu, then pick **Reset**.
