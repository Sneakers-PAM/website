# Getting a support bundle

A support bundle is one file with what it takes to diagnose an appliance: its status, the
cluster, the logs, the mounts and the update records, followed by one timeline of every log in UTC.
The box makes it by running a fixed set of read-only commands.

## Before you start

- You're an admin on the appliance. Any admin can take a bundle.
- For the SSH commands, you have a login key from the **Access** page.

## Download it from the Logs page

1. Sign in at `https://<address>:8443/` and open **Logs**.
2. Open **Advanced: support bundle**.
3. Select **Download support bundle**. The box writes the file as you wait, which can take up to 10
   minutes. It's named `support-bundle-<host>-<UTC time>.zip`.

The download is a zip file at maximum compression, holding one plain text file of the same name. It
isn't encrypted, because every line is already redacted. macOS and Windows open it with no extra
tools.

If the page says the Base OS can't make a bundle yet, update the Base OS on **Updates** and try
again.

## Get it over SSH

Sign in to the closed shell and run one of these:

```text
support-bundle
support-bundle full
support-bundle --no-color
```

- `support-bundle` prints the key sections, with about the last 50 lines of each log, for you to
  copy out of the terminal.
- `support-bundle full` prints every section, the same content as the file from the Logs page.
- On a terminal the headings, errors and warnings are in colour, and copying leaves the colour
  behind. `--no-color` turns it off.

To save the full bundle to a file from your own machine:

```sh
ssh admin@box1.example.org support-bundle full > support-bundle.txt
```

## What it leaves out

Secrets, tokens and keys are removed from every line before it's written, and a removed value reads
`[redacted]`. Secrets and environment variables show as names only. A line too long to check is left
out whole.

Read a bundle before you send it to anyone. It still holds host names, addresses and account names.

One bundle runs at a time, so a second is refused until the first ends, and each one is recorded in
the appliance's audit log.
