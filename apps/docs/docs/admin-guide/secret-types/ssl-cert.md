# 📜 SSL/PKI Certificate

A TLS or PKI certificate with its private key and chain. The subject, issuer, names, serial, fingerprint, validity and key details are read from the certificate when it's imported.

- Import a PKCS#12 / PFX, PEM, DER, PKCS#7 or JKS file. The secret's page shows the certificate's details and how long it has left.
- Export it as PEM with or without the private key (a key can be re-encrypted with a passphrase), and replace the material later from the same page.

Type id: `type-ssl-cert`. Agents and `sneakers-put` name the type by this id; `sneakers_list_secret_types` lists it.

## 🔒 What's secret {#whats-secret}

**Private Key** is masked until someone who can read the secret reveals or copies it, and every reveal and copy is written to the [audit trail](../../concepts/audit.md). Everything else is plain metadata that anyone who can see the folder can see.

**Private Key** is super-sensitive: the reveal shows a partial mask first and takes a second, deliberate reveal for the whole value. Service accounts and personal tokens can't read it while the **Allow API access to sensitive secrets** setting is off, which is the default ([security settings](../security-settings.md)). Checking out a secret of this type asks for a fresh second factor while **Require MFA for sensitive checkout** is on, also the default.

## 🔁 Heartbeat, rotation and check-out {#automation}

- **Heartbeat:** no.
- **Rotation:** no.
- **Check-out:** no.

## 🎯 Targets {#targets}

An SSL/PKI Certificate takes no target: there is no rotation for arbitrary certificates.
