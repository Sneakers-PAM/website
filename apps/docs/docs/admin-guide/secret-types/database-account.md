# 🗄️ Database Account

A database login: the engine, the server, port and database, the username and the password.

- The engine is PostgreSQL, MySQL / MariaDB, SQL Server, Oracle, MongoDB or Other.
- The secret's page shows ready-made connection examples for the engine, with a placeholder where the password goes, never the password itself.

Type id: `type-database-account`. Agents and `sneakers-put` name the type by this id; `sneakers_list_secret_types` lists it.

## 🧾 Fields {#fields}

## 🔒 What's secret {#whats-secret}

**Password** is masked until someone who can read the secret reveals or copies it, and every reveal and copy is written to the [audit trail](../../concepts/audit.md). Everything else is plain metadata that anyone who can see the folder can see.

## 🔁 Heartbeat, rotation and check-out {#automation}

- **Heartbeat:** yes, against the secret's target ([how it works](../../concepts/heartbeat-and-rotation.md#heartbeat)).
- **Rotation:** yes: rotation changes **Password** ([how it works](../../concepts/heartbeat-and-rotation.md#rotation)).
- **Check-out:** no.

- The type is marked for heartbeat and rotation, but the connector has no database adapter yet: a database target can't be checked or rotated today.

## 🎯 Targets {#targets}

A Database Account can carry a target, but no connector adapter acts on a database yet, so the target does nothing for it today. See [targets and connections](../targets-and-connections.md) for how to set one up.
