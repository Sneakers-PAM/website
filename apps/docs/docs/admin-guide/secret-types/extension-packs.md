# 📦 Extension packs

Extension packs are vendor types that ship with Sneakers-PAM but aren't installed until a site
admin imports one on the admin app's **Secret types** page. Once imported, a pack is a read-only
type like the built-in ones: people can create secrets of it, and nobody can edit it. None of them
has heartbeat, rotation or check-out.
