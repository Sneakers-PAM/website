# 🛟 Recovery / Backup Codes

The one-time recovery or backup codes a site gives you for when your authenticator is lost, with the site and account they belong to.

- Keep the codes here rather than in a file or a printout, so every look at them is audited.

Type id: `type-recovery-codes`. Agents and `sneakers-put` name the type by this id; `sneakers_list_secret_types` lists it.
