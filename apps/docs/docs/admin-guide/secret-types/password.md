# 🔑 Password

A username and a password, for any account that doesn't need a more specific type.

- Use it for an account Sneakers-PAM only stores: nothing checks it or changes it on a system.
- The password field can be generated from the folder's password policy when you create or edit the secret.

Type id: `type-password`. Agents and `sneakers-put` name the type by this id; `sneakers_list_secret_types` lists it.

## 🧾 Fields {#fields}

| Field | Key | Kind | Required | Secret | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Username | `username` | Text | Yes | No |  |
| Password | `password` | Password (can be generated) | Yes | Sensitive |  |
| Notes | `notes` | Multi-line text | No | No |  |

## 🔒 What's secret {#whats-secret}

**Password** is masked until someone who can read the secret reveals or copies it, and every reveal and copy is written to the [audit trail](../../concepts/audit.md). Everything else is plain metadata that anyone who can see the folder can see.

## 🔁 Heartbeat, rotation and check-out {#automation}

- **Heartbeat:** no.
- **Rotation:** no.
- **Check-out:** no.

## 🎯 Targets {#targets}

A Password secret takes no target. To have Sneakers-PAM check and rotate an account, use the type made for that system, such as [Active Directory Account](./active-directory.md).
