# 💳 Credit Card

A payment card: the cardholder, the card number, the expiry date and the CVV.

- The editor checks the card number (13 to 23 digits and spaces), the expiry (MM/YY or MM/YYYY) and the CVV (3 or 4 digits) before it saves.

Type id: `type-credit-card`. Agents and `sneakers-put` name the type by this id; `sneakers_list_secret_types` lists it.

## 🔒 What's secret {#whats-secret}

**Card number**, **CVV** are masked until someone who can read the secret reveals or copies them, and every reveal and copy is written to the [audit trail](../../concepts/audit.md). Everything else is plain metadata that anyone who can see the folder can see.

**Card number**, **CVV** are super-sensitive: the reveal shows a partial mask first and takes a second, deliberate reveal for the whole value. Service accounts and personal tokens can't read them while the **Allow API access to sensitive secrets** setting is off, which is the default ([security settings](../security-settings.md)). Checking out a secret of this type asks for a fresh second factor while **Require MFA for sensitive checkout** is on, also the default.

## 🔁 Heartbeat, rotation and check-out {#automation}

- **Heartbeat:** no.
- **Rotation:** no.
- **Check-out:** no.

## 🎯 Targets {#targets}

A Credit Card takes no target.
