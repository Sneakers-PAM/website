# 🖥️ Windows Account (Local)

A local account on one Windows machine: the machine, the username and the password.

Type id: `type-windows-local`. Agents and `sneakers-put` name the type by this id; `sneakers_list_secret_types` lists it.

## 🧾 Fields {#fields}

| Field | Key | Kind | Required | Secret | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Description | `description` | Multi-line text | No | No |  |
| Machine | `machine` | Text | Yes | No |  |
| Username | `username` | Text | Yes | No |  |
| Password | `password` | Password (can be generated) | Yes | Sensitive | the field rotation changes |
| Notes | `notes` | Multi-line text | No | No |  |

## 🔒 What's secret {#whats-secret}

**Password** is masked until someone who can read the secret reveals or copies it, and every reveal and copy is written to the [audit trail](../../concepts/audit.md). Everything else is plain metadata that anyone who can see the folder can see.

## 🔁 Heartbeat, rotation and check-out {#automation}

- **Heartbeat:** yes, against the secret's target ([how it works](../../concepts/heartbeat-and-rotation.md#heartbeat)).
- **Rotation:** yes: rotation changes **Password** ([how it works](../../concepts/heartbeat-and-rotation.md#rotation)).
- **Check-out:** yes: one person at a time holds it for a lease ([check-out](../../user-guide/check-out.md)).

- The type is marked for heartbeat, rotation and check-out, but they need a WinRM or SAMR connection, and neither adapter is built yet: a heartbeat or rotation over them reports the target as unreachable.

## 🎯 Targets {#targets}

A target with a WinRM connection (port 5986 over TLS by default). The connection can be saved today; checking and rotating over it aren't built yet. See [targets and connections](../targets-and-connections.md) for how to set one up.
