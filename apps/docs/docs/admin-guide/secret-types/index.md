# 🧩 Secret types

A secret's type decides which fields it has, which of them are secret, and what Sneakers-PAM can do
with it: check it against a target (the heartbeat), change it on the target (rotation), or lend it
to one person at a time (check-out). Sneakers-PAM ships with the 21 types below. They're read-only:
nobody can edit or delete a built-in type, but a site admin can clone one into a custom type on the
admin app's **Secret types** page, and import the [extension packs](./extension-packs.md).

| Type | Secret fields | Heartbeat | Rotation | Check-out | Takes a target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Password](./password.md) | Password | No | No | No | No |
| [Secure Note](./secure-note.md) | Note | No | No | No | No |
| [Web Password](./web-password.md) | Password | No | No | No | No |
| [SSH Key](./ssh-key.md) | Private Key, Passphrase | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| [API Token](./api-token.md) | Token | No | No | No | No |
| [OAuth Application](./oauth.md) | Client Secret, Access Token, Refresh Token | No | No | No | No |
| [Recovery / Backup Codes](./recovery-codes.md) | Recovery / Backup Codes | No | No | No | No |
| [Database Account](./database-account.md) | Password | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| [Password Account (SSH)](./unix-ssh.md) | Password | No | No | No | Yes |
| [Windows Account (Local)](./windows-local.md) | Password | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| [Windows Domain Account](./windows-domain.md) | Password | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| [Active Directory Account](./active-directory.md) | Password | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| [Bank Account](./bank-account.md) | Account number, Routing number, Online password | No | No | No | No |
| [Credit Card](./credit-card.md) | Card number, CVV | No | No | No | No |
| [License Key](./license-key.md) | License key | No | No | No | No |
| [Combination Lock](./combination-lock.md) | Combination | No | No | No | No |
| [PIN](./pin.md) | PIN | No | No | No | No |
| [Social Security Number](./ssn.md) | SSN | No | No | No | No |
| [Contact](./contact.md) | Email, Phone | No | No | No | No |
| [Anthropic Token](./anthropic-token.md) | Token | No | No | No | No |
| [SSL/PKI Certificate](./ssl-cert.md) | Private Key | No | No | No | No |

:::info[Heartbeat and rotation need a connector adapter]

A type marked for heartbeat or rotation still needs an adapter in the connector for its target's
protocol. LDAP, LDAPS, Kerberos and SSH work today; WinRM and SAMR are registered but report the
target as unreachable, and there is no database adapter yet. Each type's page says what works.

## 🔤 Field kinds {#field-kinds}

| Kind | What it holds |
|---|---|
| Text | Plain text, shown to anyone who can see the secret. |
| Password (can be generated) | A secret password. The editor can generate one from the folder's password policy, and rotation changes it. |
| Secret value (never generated) | A fixed secret, such as a key or a token: masked and revealed like a password, never generated or rotated. |
| Multi-line text | Longer text, such as notes or a certificate. Secret only where the type marks it so. |
| Choice | One of a fixed list of options. |
| Yes or no | A flag. |

A **Choice** field only takes one of its type's own options: creating or editing a secret with
anything else is refused, naming the field and listing the options to pick from. A value stored
before this was enforced still reads back as it was; the next save on that field has to pick a
valid option.

## 🔐 Secret and super-sensitive fields {#sensitivity}

- **Sensitive fields** are masked everywhere. Revealing or copying one is a deliberate act, written
  to the [audit trail](../../concepts/audit.md), and a site admin can require a fresh second factor first
  ([security settings](../security-settings.md)).
- **Super-sensitive fields** (card numbers, PINs, the SSN, a certificate's private key, bank
  numbers) also show a partial mask before the whole value, and service accounts and personal
  tokens can't read them unless a site admin turns on **Allow API access to sensitive secrets**.

## 🔄 Changing a secret's type {#changing-type}

A secret can move to another type. No value is ever dropped: a value with no field in the new type
is appended to the notes, or the change is refused. A secret value only moves into a secret field,
and a super-sensitive one only into a super-sensitive field.
