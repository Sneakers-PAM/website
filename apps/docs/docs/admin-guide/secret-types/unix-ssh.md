# 🐧 Password Account (SSH)

A Unix or Linux account that signs in over SSH with a password: the host, the username and the password.

- The password can be generated from the password policy, but Sneakers-PAM never checks it or changes it on the host.

Type id: `type-unix-ssh`. Agents and `sneakers-put` name the type by this id; `sneakers_list_secret_types` lists it.

## 🧾 Fields {#fields}

| Field | Key | Kind | Required | Secret | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Description | `description` | Multi-line text | No | No |  |
| Host | `host` | Text | Yes | No |  |
| Username | `username` | Text | Yes | No |  |
| Password | `password` | Password (can be generated) | Yes | Sensitive |  |
| Notes | `notes` | Multi-line text | No | No |  |

## 🔒 What's secret {#whats-secret}

**Password** is masked until someone who can read the secret reveals or copies it, and every reveal and copy is written to the [audit trail](../../concepts/audit.md). Everything else is plain metadata that anyone who can see the folder can see.

## 🔁 Heartbeat, rotation and check-out {#automation}

- **Heartbeat:** no.
- **Rotation:** no.
- **Check-out:** no.

## 🎯 Targets {#targets}

The type can carry a target with an SSH connection, but it has no heartbeat or rotation, and the web app's terminal opens SSH Key secrets only, so the target does nothing for it today. See [targets and connections](../targets-and-connections.md) for how to set one up.
