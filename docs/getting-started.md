# Getting started

Sneakers-PAM doesn't ship install media. Instead, each user builds their own appliance image
from a release the Sneakers-PAM org has signed — the build kit checks that signature and refuses
anything unsigned or modified. This keeps the chain of trust in the open: you can see exactly what
you're running, and you're never trusting a binary someone else built for you.

## What you'll end up with

A single-node appliance running the vault, identity, workflow, audit and related services, on a
pinned, signed release.

> Coming in v0.1.0: the ISO, OVA and AMI image formats, the closed admin shell and `:8443` OS admin
> page for setup, backups and upgrades, and scheduled automatic updates applied in a maintenance
> window you control.

## Before you start

- A signed release from `sneakers-release` (the pinned manifest and chart set).
- The `sneakers-appliance` build kit, which turns that release into a bootable image.
- A target to run it on: a hypervisor for an OVA, a USB drive or virtual media for an ISO, or an
  AWS account for an AMI.

## Build your image

> Coming in v0.1.0. The build kit and its exact command-line flow aren't published yet — this
> section will walk through choosing an image format, pointing the kit at a signed release, and
> verifying the signature before the image is built.

## Install

> Coming in v0.1.0. First boot enforces key-only SSH setup before anything else, then opens the
> `:8443` OS admin for the rest of setup (vault root key, networking, the first admin account).

## Upgrades and backups

> Coming in v0.1.0. Upgrades are whole, signed releases applied in a scheduled window with
> automatic rollback on failure; see [Heartbeat and rotation](/concepts/heartbeat-and-rotation) and
> the concepts pages for how the running system behaves once it's up. Backup and restore use a
> separate key from the one you log in with, and are covered here once the appliance build lands.

## Moving between appliances

> Coming in v0.1.0. `sneakers-migrate` will export a full encrypted bundle from a running
> Sneakers-PAM appliance — secrets with every version, folders, ACLs, users and groups, targets,
> schedules and the audit chain — and import it into a fresh one, re-wrapping every secret under
> the new root key.
