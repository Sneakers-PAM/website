# Secrets and folders

A **secret** is a credential Sneakers-PAM stores on your behalf: a password, a key, a token, or
another sensitive value. Every secret keeps its full history — each past value stays available,
not just the current one — so you can see what changed and when. Changing a secret's type (see
[Changing a secret's type](../change-type-guide.md)) reads in that history as the change it
actually was (old type to new, fields added, renamed or carried over), not just a list of fields
that happen to differ.

A secret's type decides which fields it has, and some of them are required: a credential saved
with a required field left empty is refused, naming the field, the same way an invalid choice on
a drop-down field is. A secret that already had one empty from before this was enforced still
opens and works; the next edit that saves that field is what completes it.

Some types get an editor of their own. A **GitHub App** secret takes the App's `.pem` file
directly and checks it's the right kind of key before it's stored, and its page has a **Replace
private key** action for when the key is rotated on GitHub. See
[Storing a GitHub App](../github-app-guide.md).

Secrets live in **folders**, and folders can be nested. A folder is where access control actually
happens: who can see that a secret exists, who can reveal its value, who can approve a request for
it, and who is just kept informed. A secret inherits its folder's rules unless it has its own. The
top of your personal folder holds folders, not secrets, so the staff app doesn't offer it as a
place for a secret: make a folder inside it first.

A secret can also be linked to one or more **targets** — the systems it actually protects, such as
a server account or a service's own config. One SSH key can open a session on every host it's
attached to, with no copies to keep in sync; attaching or detaching one target never disturbs the
others. That link is what makes [heartbeat and rotation](./heartbeat-and-rotation.md) possible:
Sneakers-PAM can check the secret against each of its targets, and change them together.

A secret's own page lists its attached targets, with an **Attach** picker for adding another and a
**Detach** button next to each one already there. Opening a terminal on an SSH Key or Password
Account (SSH) secret goes straight to the only target when it has just one; with more than one
attached, a short picker asks which to open the session on before it connects.

When the terminal can't connect yet, **Open terminal** stays in the secret's **Actions** menu,
disabled, with the reason beside it:

- **Attach a target first.** The secret has no target attached.
- **Its target doesn't connect over SSH.** None of its targets uses an SSH connection.
- **Pin the target's host key first.** None of its SSH targets has a pinned host key yet (see
  [SSH host keys](#ssh-host-keys)). A site admin also gets **Open the target in the admin app**
  in the same menu, to scan and pin it there. Anyone else is told an admin needs to pin it.

One SSH target with a pinned host key is enough to turn the action back on.

A target's own page,
in turn, lists every secret attached to it — useful for seeing at a glance what else shares a
host's credential before changing or deleting the target.

### SSH host keys

A target reached over SSH carries its own pinned host keys — the public keys that identify the
real server, so a credential is never sent to an impostor. Pinning them is always a person's
decision, made from the admin app (Targets → Scan and pin): no token, agent or automated
request — not even a site admin's — can add, change or clear a target's pins. A secret whose
target has none of its host keys pinned yet can't heartbeat until a person pins one. Each attached
target keeps its own pins.

Values are never shown by default. Revealing one is a deliberate action, and it's logged every
time — see [Approvals and requests](./approvals.md) for how a reveal gets approved and the
[security page](../security.md) for how the project treats sensitive data generally.

Most access grants are either a plain yes or a plain no. One level is narrower: a service account
can be allowed to create and update secrets in a folder, but reveal only the ones it created
itself — never the folder's other secrets. That's meant for a machine that manages its own
credentials (a host storing its own local-admin password, say) without being handed read access to
everything else nearby.

An admin sets this from the folder's access screen (admin app, Folders → the folder → Sharing),
Advanced view: clicking a subject's Reveal cell cycles blank, allow, **own**, deny, blank, so own
sits between the plain allow and deny it narrows. A secret's own page shows which principal created
it, so an admin checking this grant can see at a glance whose secrets a given own-reveal subject
can actually reveal.

### Top-level folders

By default, anyone signed in can create a top-level folder, with **New shared folder** in the staff
app's sidebar or the top-level choice in the **New Folder** dialog. A personal token can too, which
is how an agent makes one (see [Using the MCP](../mcp-guide.md#create-a-folder)).

- **It belongs to its creator.** If a token made it, it belongs to the token's user. The owner
  manages it and shares it with the people who need it.
- **Everyone signed in sees it listed, by name and owner.** The contents stay with its owners and
  site admins until an owner shares it.
- **Tokens see it once it's shared.** Until then it isn't in a token's folder list.
- **Agents can't share.** No token can change a folder's sharing, not even its owner's. A person
  does that in the staff app.

A service account or workload can't make a top-level folder, because it has no user to own it.

To limit this, a site admin turns on **Restrict top-level folders to admins** in the admin console's
**Settings**. It's off by default. While it's on, only site admins and root can create a top-level
folder, in the staff app or through a token whose owner is one. Anyone else is refused, and the
message names the setting. Subfolders aren't affected.

Moving a folder to the top level follows the same setting, so a subfolder can't be promoted around
it. The staff app offers that move to site admins only, and a token can't make it at all. Reordering
the folders already at the top level is separate, and needs an admin.
