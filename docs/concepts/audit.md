# Audit trail

Every sensitive action in Sneakers-PAM — a reveal, a check-out, an approval, a break-glass session
— is written to an append-only, hash-chained audit trail. Each record's hash covers the record
itself and the hash of the one before it, so an insert, edit, delete or reorder anywhere in the
trail is detectable: verifying the chain walks it end to end and names the first record that
doesn't fit.

Records come in two tiers:

- **Audit** — actions that touch or could touch a secret's value: reveals, check-outs,
  break-glass, rotation. These carry a solid marker, and a record involving a revealed value is
  flagged separately as sensitive.
- **Activity** — everything else worth keeping a history of, such as a request being opened or
  denied, shown with a lighter, dashed marker.

The trail records metadata about actions, never secret material itself — see
[Secrets and folders](/concepts/secrets-and-folders) for where the values themselves live, and
[Break-glass](/concepts/break-glass) for why that path in particular always lands at the audit
tier.
